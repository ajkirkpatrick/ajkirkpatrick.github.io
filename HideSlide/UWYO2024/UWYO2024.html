# About me

### Research
&gt; My research studies the drivers of the grid transition from fossil fuels to renewables in two contexts: First, by examining the economics of renewables on the grid and how wholesale electricity prices and environmental costs change as intermittent renewables and battery storage are integrated into the grid. Second, by examining household-level decisions about energy efficiency and the decision to install storage and rooftop solar, and how those decisions in aggregate affect the grid.

# Research Agendas


### Start with an overarching, big-picture topic and question
- It may be:

  - Something persistently in the news
  
  - Something with many facets
  
  - Something with many moving (economic) parts
  
  - Something with many decision-makers
  
  - A *puzzle* that you can frame
  
- It should be something that really interests **you**
  

---
class: inverseMSU
# Research Agendas

### Your interest is your comparative advantage

  - Some people find some topics intractable, impossible to digest

  - If you're super into something, your motivation to wrap your head around the problem may be *rare*
  
--

### For instance

  - Land use planning
  
  - Marine mammals and endangered species
  
  - Immigration policy
  
  - Veterans healthcare
  
  - The "gig" economy

---
class: inverseMSU
# Research Agendas

On this topic, ask:

### What questions have been answered well?

  - What has been thoroughly explained in theory?
  
  - What has been shown empirically?
  
  - What important numbers (e.g. elasticities) have been estimated?
  

---
class: inverseMSU
# Research Agendas

And then ask:

### What questions still remain?

  - What are the key question marks still in the area?
  
  - What established parts rely on strong assumptions?
  
  - **When is heterogeneity important?** (often a strong assumption of homogeneity)
  
  - What established parts would change as the world changes?

## Theory is a map of an idea

--

### Potholes and Roads

- Some research questions are "filling in potholes"

  - A "pothole" is something that doesn't expand the field or change directions, but is important to "getting to the destination"
  
  - Some good "pothole" papers are descriptive and correlational
  
  - Some refine previous estimates
  
  - Often publishing "ceiling" is a top field journal
  
  - Still important!
  
  
---
class: inverseMSU
# Research Agendas

### Potholes and Roads

- Some research questions are "roads"

  - Relaxing one of those assumptions changes results dramatically
  
  - Heterogeneity `\(\rightarrow\)` dramatically different outcomes
  
  - Still uses economic tools: welfare, surplus, efficiency are still paramount
  
  - If you were given a chance to testify before Congress on your research, what would you talk about?
  
    - "Policy lever"
  
  
---
class: inverseMSU
# Research Agendas

### A good research agenda is both filling potholes and building roads

  - Building roads is hard!
  
  - Requires theory and empirics
  
  - A good research agenda is both roads and potholes
  
  - And a good research agenda understands the existing literature
  
  
---
class: inverseMSU
# Research Agendas

### Talking about your agenda

  - Economics has a self-promotion component
  
  - Talking about your agenda is drawing the map of roads and identifying potholes
  
    - Your short 3-sentence agenda
  
    - Your description of the components
  
    - Your potholes and your roads
    
    - "Following a thread"
    
  - Policy lever

- Decades ago, we had maybe 2,000 generators producing electricity
  - Today, we have millions of generators
  - Solar, batteries
- Demand = Supply down to the microsecond
  - Today, not so much

Valuing Solar Subsidies &lt;br&gt; .font30[(w/ K. Gillingham, B. Bollinger)]


---
class: inverseMSU
# Context

### Focus on Net metering incentive

- During sunny periods, "spin the meter backwards"
  - Offsets consumption after sunset, lowering total amount billed.
  - Depending on "true-up period", can bank net-negative months
  - Utility acts like a *battery*, banking during day, offseting at night.
--

- Effect on bill
  - Under **increasing block-tier pricing**, net metering allows consumer to sell power to the utility at the retail rate the consumer faces
  - If each kWh reduces bill by higher tier rates that are above wholesale rates, then net metering is a **flow (monthly) subsidy**
--

- Solar households pay far less, even when depending on grid electricity.
  - Fixed costs are often included in per-kWh retail prices, thus there could be a cost-shift to non-solar households.

# Context

### Solar Net Metering provides a flow benefit to solar adopters
- May be rationalized by reduction in externalities
  - Probably not: &lt;a name=cite-sextonHeterogeneousSolarCapacity2021a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[Sexton, Kirkpatrick, Harris, and Muller (2021)](#bib-sextonHeterogeneousSolarCapacity2021a)
- Learn-by-doing: 
  - Only partly: [Bollinger and Gillingham (2012)](#bib-Bollinger2012)
- Long-run innovation incentives:
  - Some, but second-best approach [Gerarden, Newell, and Stavins (2017)](#bib-gerardenAssessingEnergyEfficiencyGap2017)
- Nevertheless, it continues

--

### NPV of flow payoff depends on household discount rate `\(\delta\)`
&lt;!-- - Under high household discount rates and low government borrowing rates, a budget-neutral up-front subsidy policy may be more effective --&gt;

--

### Household **heterogeneity** in `\(\delta\)` `\(\rightarrow\)` different NPV for adoption


---
class: MSU
exclude: true
# Context

### `\(\delta\)` may explain differences in solar adoption across wealth and income
- Bednar, Reames, and Keoleian (2017) show lower-wealth households tend to spend *more* on electricity per sq ft
  - Borenstein and Davis (2016) top quintile of income received 60% of all federal tax benefits
  - Sunter, Castellanos, and Kammen (2019)    
  - O'Shaughnessy et al (2020) on income inequity in solar adoption
  - O'Shaughnessy (2022) and Borenstein (2022) in *Nature Energy*

# Research Questions

### Q1: How do households discount future payoffs from solar?

This speaks to economic efficiency of any similar flow subsidy

--

### Q2: Do discount rates vary systematically over wealth?

This speaks to whether or not the choice to use a potentially inefficient flow incentive (like net metering) exacerbates distributional differences.

--

### Policy lever: put the subsidy up front 
- Increase efficiency with up-front subsidies
- If discount rates vary systematically `\(\rightarrow\)` less disparity in solar uptake.
- Many states working on new versions of net metering
- Any proposed reform requires understanding effect of flow vs. up-front subsidies by wealth or income

# Literature

### Discount rates in energy investments: Energy-Efficiency Gap
- Large literature finding implicit discount rates between 10% and 30+%
  - .font70[Hausman (1979); Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013); Bollinger (2015); see Train (1985) for early summary]

### Discount rates in solar panel adoption
- de Groote and Verboven (2019) find 15% implicit discount rates
  - Identified using dynamic model of installation shares in Belgium with time variation in per-kWh-produced subsidy, panel costs
  - Abstracts away from household variation in cost, potential generation.
  
### Discount rates over wealth
- Lawrance (1991) - 12-20% using PSID
- Houde and Myers (2021) find heterogeneity in valuation of flow energy costs relative to up-front costs
  - Uses zip-level aggregate purchases and wealth; county-year level variation in energy costs


---
class: MSU
# Overview

### This paper
- Household-level variation allows for credible estimates of heterogeneous `\(\delta\)`

--

Estimating discount rates requires variation that changes expected discounted future utilities without affecting current period utility (Magnac and Thesmar (2002))

- Household variation in flow incentives (payoff) comes from:
  - Variation in electricity rates over *location*
  - Variation in electricity rates over *time*
  - Variation in consumption levels over *household*
  - **Variation in potential generation over household**

**Climate zones** allow different thresholds for block pricing steps.

- Two identical households with identical consumption on each side will face different marginal prices, different average prices, different payoff from solar.

- Rates (at each of 4 tiers) change over time.

# Model

### Overview
Modeling demand as consumers make dynamic decisions about whether to adopt. 

--

Consumers consider:
- Discounted flow of offset electricity
- Up-front cost


Dynamics 
- Value of waiting depends on state variables
- Differs by rooftop irradiance

Tradeoff between flow and up-front cost differs by:
- Lease vs. own
- Initial household consumption

--

Once we account for these, estimate discount rates as a function of household characteristics, primarily wealth.

# Model

Consumers assume
- electricity prices evolve `\(p'(x) = (1+\zeta)p(x)\)`
- panel generation depreciates: `\(q' = (1-\lambda)q\)`

Then:
`$$\delta_1 = \theta q^*\bar{p} - VC(K^*) - FC + X\beta$$`
`\(q^*\bar{p}\)` is the value of electricity *displaced by* solar in first year, and `\(\theta\)` converts this to the present:

`$$\theta = \sum_{t=1}^T ((1+\zeta)(1-\lambda)\rho)^{(t-1)}$$`

Discount factor `\(\rho = \frac{1}{1+\delta}\)`

# Model

Normalize outside option:

`$$\delta_0 = 0 + \sigma \epsilon_0$$`
Using Hotz and Miller (1993) Conditional Choice Probability (CCP) leads to:


`$$\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_1-\delta_0 &amp;=&amp;  (1-\rho(1+\zeta) )   \theta q^* \bar{p}    - (1-\rho \eta) VC(K^*) - (1-\rho) FC +\\
&amp; &amp;(1-\rho)X \beta + \sigma \rho (\log(Pr'_1) - .5772)

This produces the familiar logit form for the probability of adopting, and the likelihood function.

### Lease model
- Lease price: `\(p^{ppa} = \frac{TC(K^*)(1+\kappa^{TC})}{\theta^{I}} \frac{1}{q^*}\)`
  - `\(\theta^I\)` is identical to `\(\theta\)`, but with installers discount rate `\(\sim 4\%\)`
  - `\(\kappa^{TC}\)` is markup on the cost of capital
- Leasing can then be written as a multiplicative factor on cost:



`$$\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_1^l-\delta_0^l &amp;=&amp;  (1-\rho(1+\zeta) )   \theta q^* \bar{p}    - \\
&amp; &amp;\color{blue}{\frac{\theta^{ppa}}{\theta^I}(1+\kappa^{TC})}\left((1-\rho \eta) VC(K^*) + (1-\rho) FC \right) + \\
&amp; &amp;(1-\rho)X \beta + \sigma \rho (\log(Pr'_1) - .5772)
\end{eqnarray}$$`

Where: `\(\frac{\theta^{ppa}}{\theta^{I}} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^T ((1+\zeta^{ppa})(1-\lambda)\rho)^{(t-1)}}{\sum_{t=1}^T ((1+\zeta^{ppa})(1-\lambda)\rho^I)^{(t-1)}}\)`



The term in blue is unity for purchasers, simplifying computation.

`$$\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_1^l-\delta_0^l &amp;=&amp;  (1-\rho(1+\zeta) )  \left( \theta q^{*}\bar{p} \color{blue}{ -  \theta^{ppa} q^* \kappa^{p}} \right)   - \\
&amp; &amp;\color{blue}{\frac{\theta^{ppa}}{\theta^I}(1+\kappa^{TC})}\left((1-\rho \eta) VC(K^*) + (1-\rho) FC \right) + \\

# Model             

### Unobserved states: consumption and lease/purchase type
- Conditional on `\(b\)` and `\(e\)` (and given parameter vector), we can calculate `\(Pr(adopt)\)`
- Unobserved heterogeneity in `\(b\)` and `\(e\)` using Arcidiacono and Miller (2011), 
  - Integrate likelihood over 10 unobserved states: 5 bins `\(b\)` and 2 types `\(e\)`
  - `\(w_{ibe}\)` is the probability that `\(i\)` is in consumption bin `\(b\)` and type `\(e\)`

`$$\begin{eqnarray}
\text{s.t.} \quad \sum_{e=1}^2 \sum_{b=1}^5 w_{ibe} &amp;=&amp; 1;\quad \sum_{i=1}^{N_z} \sum_{e=1}^2 w_{ibe} &amp;=&amp; \frac{N^{z}}{5}
\end{eqnarray}$$`

- Where `\(N^z\)` is the number of households in the zip code. 
- Constraints are intuitive: within a household, must sum to 1. Within zipcode, must sum to `\(N^z\)`, the total number of households in that zip
  - Constrains weights to match moments of `\(q^0\)`

# Model

### Calculating `\(w_{ibe}\)`
Method for updating weights is given in AM2011:

`$$\begin{eqnarray}
w_{ibe}^{(1)} = \frac{\Pi_{z(i),be}L_{ibe}}{\sum_i \Pi_{z(i),be}L_{ibe}}
\end{eqnarray}$$`

where `\(|B|\)` is the number of consumption bins. `\(\Pi_{z(i),be}\)` is the average (over `\(i\)`) value of `\(w_{ibe}\)` within household `\(i\)`'s zip code:


`$$\begin{eqnarray}
\Pi_{z,be} = \frac{1}{N^z} \sum_{i\in \mathcal{Z}(i)} w_{ibe}
\end{eqnarray}$$`

---
class: MSU
exclude: true
# Model

The zip-level constraint will not always be satisfied. Rescale `\(w_{ibe}^{(1)}\)` 

`$$\begin{eqnarray*}
w_{ibe}^{(1')} = \frac{N^z}{|B|}\frac{w_{ibe}^{(1)}}{\sum_i w_{ibe}^{(1)}}\\
w_{ibe}^{(1'')} = \frac{w_{ibe}^{(1')}}{\sum_b \sum_e w_{ibe}^{(1')}}
\end{eqnarray*}$$`

Repeat until convergence. This ensures that the constraints are met, but preserves the within- and across-household likelihood.

#### **Q1**: To what degree do households discount the flow...?

&lt;img src="./img/rates_avg_v3.jpg" width="500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

`\(\theta\)` converts `\(q^{*}\bar{p}\)`, the per-period flow payoff, into a present value.

`\(\delta=13.1%\)` implies `\(\theta=42.46\)`, or 2.29x the NPV at a government discount rate of 4%.

# Research Question

### `\(H_0\)`: Energy Inequity is in part the result of a *hysteresis* effect rooted in historic housing discrimination.
Redlining was a "critical juncture" that separated otherwise similar housing stock.

- Test by examining modern differences in home energy services quality between redlined and observably similar non-redlined households, measured as 
  - (1) .orange[*presence of sufficient heating technology*] and 
  - (2) .orange[*energy consumption responses to cold weather shocks*]
  - Controlling for historic and current small neighborhood characteristics

--

#### Not addressed here
- Lending discrimination debatably ended with CRA in 1977. Households able to migrate, re-sort. Why does Energy Inequity persist?
- Test for "stickiness" of neighborhood. 
  - High non-market moving costs, neighborhood support, family proximity...
  
#### Historic data `\(\rightarrow\)` many assumptions

- Nardone et al (2019) asthma and redlined areas
- Aaronson et al (2020) examined credit availability in redlined areas over 1930-1980 with RD-based analysis

### Enlightening and incredibly inconvenient:
Fishback, La Voice, Shertzer, and Walsh (2020) on **endogeneity of redlining designation.**
- Used linked 1930 census address data and HOLC maps to show that redlined areas captured pre-existing economic and racial discontinuities in space.
- Border discontinuities not smooth in unobserveds. Even large moves in boundaries would still capture pre-existing segregations.
- Hillier (2003) no widespread proof that HOLC maps were distributed and used.

Given consumption, rate structure, and Google Sunroof profile, find optimal capacity to install.
1. Calculate marginal cost per kWh of solar generation
  - Starts low
  - Increases based on roof
  - Reflects cost of panels
2. Calculate marginal cost per kWh from the grid
  - Based on annual consumption
  - Decreases as solar generation increases
3. Optimal is when `\(MC_{grid}=MC_{solar}\)`
  - May be "lumpy" due to steps
  
`\(K^*\)` is optimal size; `\(q^*\)` is optimal generation; `\(q^*\bar{p}\)` is annual value of generation]]

# Model

Following Hotz and Miller (1993) and treating solar adoption as an exit state: [Back](#backModel)

`$$\begin{eqnarray}
v_0 &amp;=&amp; \delta_0 + \sigma \epsilon_0 \nonumber \\
\delta_0 &amp;=&amp; \rho\left(.5772 + \int \delta'_1 - ln(Pr'_1)dF(TC'|TC)\right)
\end{eqnarray}$$`

Using estimated change in: `\(VC' = \eta VC\)`:

`$$\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_1-\delta_0 &amp;=&amp;  (1-\rho(1+\zeta) )   \theta q^* \bar{p}    - (1-\rho \eta) VC(K^*) - (1-\rho) FC + \\
&amp; &amp;(1-\rho)X \beta + \rho (\log(Pr'_1) - .5772)
\end{eqnarray}$$`

And

`$$Pr_1 = \Lambda\left(\frac{1}{\sigma}(\delta_1 - \delta_0)\right)$$`

`$$\rho_i = \rho + \alpha_{low} 1(\text{wealth}_i&lt;\tau^{wealth}_{33}) + \alpha_{med} 1(\tau^{wealth}_{33}&lt;\text{wealth}_i&lt;\tau^{wealth}_{67})$$`

- Cross-sectional variation in `\(q^{*}\bar{p}\)` allows identification of `\(\alpha_{low}\)`, `\(\alpha_{med}\)`, `\(\rho\)`.
- Both income and value dummies included in `\(X\)` as well.
  - Main effect = information/inattention
