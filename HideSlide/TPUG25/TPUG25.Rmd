# Overview

### Tackles uncertainty in climate policy
- ~~Climate Policy~~ Energy systems models
  - Can't study climate policy without an energy system model
  - Grid is 33% of US emissions
    - Vastly more if transport is largely electrified
  - Useful for understanding grid evolution, not just for climate policy

# Overview

### Big contribution here
- Data uncertainty on the assumptions about future inputs
  - Future electricity demand
  - Future NG prices
  - Future interest rates
  - **joint** distributions
- Data uncertainty is $Y = f(\tilde{X})$
  - Model uncertainty $Y = \tilde{f}(X)$
  - We can't know model inputs $X_t$ perfectly, so draw from distribution and run simulation
  - Joint distribution of many time series'
- Allows for strikingly many more inputs to be forecast
  - Regional detail (!!)
  - Transmission constraints considered

# Overview

### True model
$$Y = f(X) + e$$

- $Y$ is outcome (CO2)
- $X$ are variables (e.g. inputs)
- $e$ is irreducible error
- Problem
  - Don't know $f(\cdot)$
  - Don't know $X$ in future
  - and don't observe $e$
]



.pull-right[
### What we get

$$\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(\hat{X}) + \hat{e}$$

- What if $\hat{X} \neq X$
  - *Data uncertainty*
  - The focus of this paper
  - We can't know model inputs $X_t$ perfectly, so draw from distribution and run simulation
  - Joint distribution of many time series'

- Differs from $\tilde{f}(\cdot) \neq f(\cdot)$
  - *Model uncertainty*
  - Uses grid model from previous work, calibrated on 2019 data

# Overview


### Dynamic Factor Model
- Many variables $\rightarrow$ PCA $\rightarrow$ small number of factors
  - E.g. each region is projected back from factor
- Small number of factors (9) is feasible for VAR
- Draw factor from VAR results, draw input $X_t$ from factor results, 
  - Optimize operation and optimize investment for 2030

### Data-driven parsimony
- Elegant in construction

# Comment 1

### Illustrate correlation between key inputs
- Think: NG price and interest rate
  - Macroeconomic conditions
- Does the DFM predict correlations similar to observed?

### **How often do grid simulation-based policy analyses use two highly correlated inputs in separate scenarios**?
  - Table of scenarios from 5-6 published IRA papers
  - Show any cases of scenarios that assume correlations (e.g. "high NG/high interest rate scenario")
  - `r emo::ji('bus')`

# Comment 2

### VAR on factors assumes stable relationship
- But does IRA potentially affect those relationships?
- Major policy, major changes $\rightarrow$ factors

### For instance
- PTC may drive lower battery costs $\rightarrow$ co-adoption of battery + solar
  - $\Rightarrow$ Peak electricity demand relation to electricity sales in a state may be affected
- Other IRA programs interact
  - Temperature and electricity sales relationship may be affected by e.g. heat pumps and EVs


### Even factor trends may be affected
- Forecast energy demand factor trend estimated pre-2019 -- EVs?
- 2018 CEC forecast for 2030 "low demand" scenario was 326 TWh
  - DFM predicts 275-355 TWh

# Comment 3

### Overnight Capital Costs of new generation
- Annualized cost per unit capacity $F_j = OCC \cdot \frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1}$
- $r$ forecast in VAR
- Conservative estimates on $OCC$ declines by 2030

### Uncertainty on $OCC$
- (admittedly ad hoc) distribution on $OCC$ for 2030

### "Dynamic" $OCC$
- Scale effects, endogenous technlogical innovation (e.g. `r Citet(myBib, c('gerardenDemanding2023'))`)

# Smaller comments

### I: 2 characteristic days
- 1 peak day, 1 off-peak day, weighted $\frac{1}{90},\frac{89}{90}$
- 2 points does not capture "curvature" of dispatch and cost
- 3 points? Bottom 50%, next 24%, then top 1%?



### II: Transmission constraints as choice variable
- Transmission constraints assumed to be static
- Investments in interstate transmission & improvements in siting/planning of transmission part of IRA
- Can transmission upgrades be a choice variable?
  - Are nomogram constraints binding at key hours/seasons?

<!-- class: MSU -->
<!-- # Some points -->

<!-- - Important to MEF papers -->
<!-- - Dynamics / technology reducing cost in future (LBD at industrial scale)?? -->
<!--   - Overnight capital costs (OCC) could be drawn from reasonable (orthogona) distribution? -->
<!-- - Not just climate policy (Grid investment? then it's endogenous) -->

<!-- - Nomogram over time -->
<!--   - Esp. important as it's set up for one grid, but future grid is very different -->
<!--   - Is there a simple way to endogenize changes to the nomogram?  -->

<!-- - Peak / near-peak 25% / off-peak? Why only 2? Curvature? -->

<!-- - Does policy choice (e.g. IRA) change how the factors move together? (Soren's idea) -->
<!--   - Would a carbon price change how interest rate and NG move together? -->
