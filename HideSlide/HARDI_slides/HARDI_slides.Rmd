# Research Question

## Context
- Many states are turning to building electrification for meeting energy goals (NY, ME, MA, VT, CA, CT, ...)

- Electricity prices in some places are [much higher than the cost of making electricity](#PriceDistortions) due to a variety of reasons.

- These artificially high electricity prices are a barrier to adopting heat pumps. 

  - Especially important for [propane users](#HeatExpenditure), who tend to spend more on heating, have lower income, and face volatile propane prices.
  
--
  
### Q: How would heat pump sales change if electricity prices were set equal to costs? 

### Q: Would savings be higher for propane users?

# Data Needs


### Key: How important are energy prices for fuel switching?

- If electricity prices go up in a region, are fewer heat pumps installed relative to a region where electricity prices did not increase?

- If propane prices are more volatile in a region, are more heat pumps installed relative to a less volatile region?

--

### Your data can help answer this question

- We can measure fuel switching using the *quantities, prices, and fuel types of heaters and air conditioners shipped to each market over time.*

- We can combine that with utility rates and propane prices in each market over time.

# How can our research help you?


### We will show how consumer demand depends on:

  - Different energy prices

  - Different subsidy schemes
  
  - Different retail prices
  
### We will show whether propane-to-heat pump switching increases when propane prices increase or become more volatile

  - Helpful for demand trend forecasting, planning

### We are open to other overlapping questions, just ask.

# Data Requests

### Optimal data
- We know national level monthly [shipments](#AnnualShipments), but to really answer the questions, we need **product x market x time** data with price and quantity.

  - Product: Model, size, rating, fuel type, CCHP

  - Market: County, metro area, or state
  
  - Time: Month or quarter

### Data security
- Experienced at handling confidential data

- Experienced with data security agreements (e.g. Medicare individual billing records, address-level electricity bills, etc.)

- Common to provide review for confidentiality (but not content)
