<!-- # Context -->

<!-- ### Net metering incentive -->

<!-- - Solar self-generation offsets consumption within a month, regardless of when the kWh is produced. -->


<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Effect on bill -->
<!--   - Allows consumer to reduce amount paid to utility by the retail rate per kWh generated during month -->
<!--   - Under **block-tier pricing**, bill reduction starts at highest rate. -->
<!--   - If each kWh reduces bill by retail rate, but utility could acquire that kWh at wholesale rate, net metering is a **flow (monthly) subsidy** -->
<!--   - While not from government accounts, this **is** a transfer from non-solar to solar customers -->

# Context


### Sustainable and "green" goods often reqire up-front investment
- EVs
- Solar panels


### Benefits are a "flow" over time


---
class: inverseMSU
# Context

### Focus on Solar Net metering incentive

- During sunny periods, "spin the meter backwards"
  - Offsets consumption after sunset, lowering total amount billed.
  - Depending on "true-up period", can bank net-negative months
  - Utility acts like a *battery*, banking during day, offseting at night.
--

- Effect on bill
  - Under **increasing block-tier pricing**, net metering allows consumer to sell power to the utility at the retail rate the consumer faces
  - If each kWh reduces bill by higher tier rates that are above wholesale rates, then net metering is a **flow (monthly) subsidy**
--

- Solar households pay far less, even when depending on grid electricity.
  - Fixed costs are often included in per-kWh retail prices, thus there could be a cost-shift to non-solar households.

### Net metering has been controversial

# Context

### Solar Net Metering provides a flow benefit to solar adopters
- May be rationalized by reduction in externalities
  - Probably not: Sexton et al. (2021)
- Learn-by-doing: 
  - Only partly: Bollinger and Gillingham (2019)
- Long-run innovation incentives:
  - Some, but second-best approach Gerarden (2017)
- Nevertheless, it continues

--

### NPV of flow payoff depends on household discount rate
<!-- - Under high household discount rates and low government borrowing rates, a budget-neutral up-front subsidy policy may be more effective -->

--

### Household **heterogeneity** in rate $\rightarrow$ different NPV for adoption


---
class: MSU
# Context

### Discount rate may explain differences in solar adoption across wealth and income
- Bednar, Reames, and Keoleian (2017) show lower-wealth households tend to spend *more* on electricity per sq ft
  - Borenstein and Davis (2016) top quintile of income received 60% of all federal tax benefits
  - Sunter, Castellanos, and Kammen (2019)    
  - O'Shaughnessy et al (2020) on income inequity in solar adoption
  - O'Shaughnessy (2022) and Borenstein (2022) in *Nature Energy*

# Research Questions

### Q1: How do households discount future payoffs from solar?

This speaks to economic efficiency of any similar flow subsidy

--

### Q2: Do discount rates vary systematically over wealth?

This speaks to whether or not the choice to use a potentially inefficient flow incentive (like net metering) exacerbates distributional differences.

--

### Policy lever: put the subsidy up front 
- Increase efficiency with up-front subsidies
- If discount rates vary systematically $\rightarrow$ less disparity in solar uptake.
- Many states working on new versions of net metering
- Any proposed reform requires understanding effect of flow vs. up-front subsidies by wealth or income

# Literature

### Discount rates in energy investments: Energy-Efficiency Gap
- Large literature finding implicit discount rates between 10% and 30+%
  - .font70[Hausman (1979); Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013); Bollinger (2015); see Train (1985) for early summary]

### Discount rates in solar panel adoption
- de Groote and Verboven (2019) find 15% implicit discount rates
  - Identified using dynamic model of installation shares in Belgium with time variation in per-kWh-produced subsidy, panel costs
  - Abstracts away from household variation in cost, potential generation.
  
### Discount rates over wealth
- Lawrance (1991) - 12-20% using PSID
- Houde and Myers (2021) find heterogeneity in valuation of flow energy costs relative to up-front costs
  - Uses zip-level aggregate purchases and wealth; county-year level variation in energy costs

# Overview

<!-- ### This paper leverages variation across time and household in the "solar payoff" to estimate discount rates (Q1), allowing for heterogeneity by wealth (Q2). -->


### This paper
- Household-level variation allows for credible estimates of heterogeneous discount rates


--

Estimating discount rates requires variation that changes expected discounted future utilities without affecting current period utility (Magnac and Thesmar (2002))

- Household variation in flow incentives (payoff) comes from:
  - Variation in electricity rates over *location*
  - Variation in electricity rates over *time*
  - Variation in consumption levels over *household*
  - **Variation in potential generation over household**

### Overview
Modeling demand as consumers make dynamic decisions about whether to adopt. 

--

Consumers consider:
- Discounted flow of offset electricity
- Up-front cost


Dynamics 
- Value of waiting depends on state variables
- Differs by rooftop irradiance

Tradeoff between flow and up-front cost differs by:
- Lease vs. own
- Initial household consumption

--

Once we account for these, estimate discount rates as a function of household characteristics, primarily wealth.

# Model

Utility of adopting:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
v_1 &=& \delta_1 + \sigma \epsilon_1 \nonumber \\
\delta_1 &=& \underbrace{\color{green}{\int_{q_0-q^*}^{q_0}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{1}{(1+\delta)^{t-1}} p_t(x)dx}}  &-&  VC(K^*) - FC  +X \beta  \nonumber \\
\delta_1 &=& \overbrace{\color{green}{\theta q^*\bar{p}}}^{\text{Discounted value of offset electricity}} &-& VC(K^*) - FC + X\beta \nonumber \\
\text{where} \quad \theta &=& \sum_{t=1}^T ((1+\zeta)(1-\lambda)\rho)^{(t-1)} &
\end{eqnarray}$$

- $T$ is lifetime of panels (25yr)

# Model

Consumers assume
- electricity prices evolve $p'(x) = (1+\zeta)p(x)$
- panel generation depreciates: $q' = (1-\lambda)q$

Then:
$$\delta_1 = \theta q^*\bar{p} - VC(K^*) - FC + X\beta$$
$q^*\bar{p}$ is the value of electricity *displaced by* solar in first year, and $\theta$ converts this to the present:

$$\theta = \sum_{t=1}^T ((1+\zeta)(1-\lambda)\rho)^{(t-1)}$$

Discount factor $\rho = \frac{1}{1+\delta}$


---
class: MSU
# Model

Normalize outside option:

$$\delta_0 = 0 + \sigma \epsilon_0$$
Using Hotz and Miller (1993) Conditional Choice Probability (CCP) leads to:


$$\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_1-\delta_0 &=&  (1-\rho(1+\zeta) )   \theta q^* \bar{p}    - (1-\rho \eta) VC(K^*) - (1-\rho) FC +\\
& &(1-\rho)X \beta + \sigma \rho (\log(Pr'_1) - .5772)
\end{eqnarray}$$

This produces the familiar logit form for the probability of adopting, and the likelihood function.

### Heterogeneity in discount rate by wealth

$$\rho_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 1(\text{wealth}_i = med) + \alpha_2 1(\text{wealth}_i = high)$$

$\rho$ is a function of observables (wealth) to allow for heterogeneity in discount rate by wealth.

# Model

### Three main issues
- $Pr'_1$ is household-specific
  - Cannot subsume into intercept as different roof profiles will have different adoption probabilities
  
- A large number of adopters lease their systems

- $q^0$ (initial consumption) is not observed for non-adopters
  - Do observe zipcode distribution (quintiles)

- Estimate a logit with $X$'s, flexibly interacted, including a time trend and boundary zone FE
- Predict $Pr'_1$ by advancing
  - Rate by $\zeta^{b}$
  - $VC$ by $\eta$
  - Time +1

class: MSU
# Model

### Lease vs. Own
- We observe which installations are leased, but not the terms
- We assume leaser/purchaser is a permanent, unobserved state (type)
- Write model conditional on type
  - Owner: same as before
  - Leaser: incorporate payment to lessor
  - Computationally, easiest to write as a change in up-front cost, possible when $\rho_i$ is known or estimated
  


---
class: MSU
# Model

### Lease model
- Lease price: $p^{ppa} = \frac{TC(K^*)(1+\kappa^{TC})}{\theta^{I}} \frac{1}{q^*}$
  - $\theta^I$ is identical to $\theta$, but with installers discount rate $\sim 4\%$
  - $\kappa^{TC}$ is markup on the cost of capital
- Leasing can then be written as a multiplicative factor on cost that varies with $\rho$:

--


$$\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_1^l-\delta_0^l &=&  (1-\rho(1+\zeta) )   \theta q^* \bar{p}    - \\
& &\color{blue}{\frac{\theta^{ppa}}{\theta^I}(1+\kappa^{TC})}\left((1-\rho \eta) VC(K^*) + (1-\rho) FC \right) + \\
& &(1-\rho)X \beta + \sigma \rho (\log(Pr'_1) - .5772)
\end{eqnarray}$$

Where: $\frac{\theta^{ppa}}{\theta^{I}} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^T ((1+\zeta^{ppa})(1-\lambda)\rho)^{(t-1)}}{\sum_{t=1}^T ((1+\zeta^{ppa})(1-\lambda)\rho^I)^{(t-1)}}$

--

The term in blue is unity for purchasers, simplifying computation.

---
class: MSU
# Model

### Lease model continued
- A per-kWh markup $\kappa^{p}$ can be accommodated:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_1^l-\delta_0^l &=&  (1-\rho(1+\zeta) )  \left( \theta q^{*}\bar{p} \color{blue}{ -  \theta^{ppa} q^* \kappa^{p}} \right)   - \\
& &\color{blue}{\frac{\theta^{ppa}}{\theta^I}(1+\kappa^{TC})}\left((1-\rho \eta) VC(K^*) + (1-\rho) FC \right) + \\
& &(1-\rho)X \beta + \sigma \rho (\log(Pr'_1) - .5772)
\end{eqnarray}$$

### Unobserved states: consumption and lease/purchase type
- Conditional on consumption $b$ and type $e$ (and given parameter vector), we can calculate $Pr(adopt)$ and the conditional likelihood $L_{ibe}$.
- Unobserved heterogeneity in $b$ and $e$
  - Integrate likelihood over 10 unobserved states: 5 bins $b$ and 2 types $e$
- **But** must constrain s.t. $w_{ibe}$ sums over $b$ within zip $z$ to $\frac{N_{zip}}{5}$
  - .red[Enforcing the constraint makes] $w_{ibe}$ .red[depend on] $w_{jbe}$
    - Rules out Arcidiacono and Miller (2011) method for unobserved consumption.

# Model
  
###Integrating $L$ over b, e.
- Draw (once) $R = 1,000$ random allocations of consumption $b$: $b^{(r)}$
- For each evaluation of the likelihood function:
  1. Evaluate at the parameters to get conditional likelihood $L_{ibe}$
  1. Calculate weights for type $e$ conditional on $b$: $w_{ie|b}$ = $\frac{L_{ieb}}{L_{ieb}+L_{ie'b}}$ following Arcidiacono and Miller (2011).
  1. For each allocation, sum the $w_{ie|b}$-weighted $L_{ibe}$ for $b = b^{(r)}$ into $L_{ib^{(r)}}$
  1. Calculate probability of observing each allocation conditional on $L$ as $w^{(r)}_z = \frac{\Pi_{i\in z} L_{ib^{(r)}}}{\sum_r \Pi_{i\in z} L_{ib^{(r)}}}$
  1. Calculate the log-likelihood $LL_i$ by $LL_i = log\left(\sum_{(r)} w_z^{(r)} L_{ib^{(r)}}\right)$
  1. Sum $LL = \sum_i LL_i$

#### **Q1**: To what degree do households discount the flow...?

```{r rateTable, out.width = '500px'}

# see "Explore_Results_v4.Rmd"
# 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(imageFolder, 'rates_avg_v3.png'))

```

$\theta$ converts $q^{*}\bar{p}$, the per-period flow payoff, into a present value.

$13.7\%$ implies $\theta=42.64$, or 2.2x the NPV at a government discount rate of 4%.

### Reduce up-front costs by 1%
Increased installations reduce damages from criteria pollutants and reduce $CO_2$ emitted, but only slightly

### Proposed NEM Rate of $.0625/kWh
- From [CPUC-comissioned Avoided Cost Calculator](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/-/media/cpuc-website/divisions/energy-division/documents/demand-side-management/acc-models-latest-version/2022-acc-documentation-v1a.pdf)
- $.0625/kWh is average avoided cost for normalized load shape of solar

### Proposed NEM Rate, but equivalent up-front subsidy 
- Proposed NEM Rate of $.0625 reduces flow payoff
- Subsidize by up-front value of net change in flow
- Budget-neutral to gov't assuming 4% government discount rate

```{r, out.width = '80%', eval = F, include = F}

# knitr::include_graphics(file.path(imageFolder, 'cf.UP_20221229_12_PredInstalls1.png'))

# Conclusion

### Household discount rates exceed government borrowing rate
- Efficiency gains from up-front payments
- Important for redesigning NEM
- Applies to many flow subsidies for up-front investments

### Heterogeneity across wealth in discount rates
- Explains disparity in adoption
- Suggests possible gains in distributional equity across wealth from upfront payments

.less-right[.font70[
Given consumption, rate structure, and Google Sunroof profile, find optimal capacity to install.
1. Calculate marginal cost per kWh of solar generation
  - Starts low
  - Increases based on roof
  - Reflects cost of panels
2. Calculate marginal cost per kWh from the grid
  - Based on annual consumption
  - Decreases as solar generation increases
3. Optimal is when $MC_{grid}=MC_{solar}$
  - May be "lumpy" due to steps
  
$K^*$ is optimal size; $q^*$ is optimal generation; $q^*\bar{p}$ is annual value of generation]]

# Model

Following Hotz and Miller (1993) and treating solar adoption as an exit state: [Back](#backModel)

$$\begin{eqnarray}
v_0 &=& \delta_0 + \sigma \epsilon_0 \nonumber \\
\delta_0 &=& \rho\left(.5772 + \int \delta'_1 - ln(Pr'_1)dF(TC'|TC)\right)
\end{eqnarray}$$

Using estimated change in: $VC' = \eta VC$:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_1-\delta_0 &=&  (1-\rho(1+\zeta) )   \theta q^* \bar{p}    - (1-\rho \eta) VC(K^*) - (1-\rho) FC + \\
& &(1-\rho)X \beta + \rho (\log(Pr'_1) - .5772)
\end{eqnarray}$$

And

$$Pr_1 = \Lambda\left(\frac{1}{\sigma}(\delta_1 - \delta_0)\right)$$

# Model

### Household heterogeneity in $\rho$: .footnote[[Back](#backModel)]

$$\rho_i = \rho + \alpha_{low} 1(\text{wealth}_i<\tau^{wealth}_{33}) + \alpha_{med} 1(\tau^{wealth}_{33}<\text{wealth}_i<\tau^{wealth}_{67})$$

- Cross-sectional variation in $q^{*}\bar{p}$ allows identification of $\alpha_{low}$, $\alpha_{med}$, $\rho$.
- Both income and value dummies included in $X$ as well.
  - Main effect = information/inattention
