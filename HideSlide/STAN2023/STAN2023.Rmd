# What does this paper do?


### Quantifies reallocation within a conglomerate
- Measures the effect of an energy reduction mandate on energy consumption, output, profits, and welfare
- Looks across affiliates in a conglomerate where the largest affiliate is subject to regulation, but smaller affiliates are not
  - Considers reallocation within-conglomerate, across affiliates
  
--

### Quantifies reallocation within a market 
- Looks across conglomerates in a market
  - Prices change when top firms are regulated via reallocation to affiliates
  - Prices also change as firms/conglomerates with no regulated affiliates adjust

--

### Implications for
- Energy consumption (policy target)
- Profits
- Consumer welfare

# What does this paper do?

### Firms are directly regulated, related to regulated, and unrelated

.pull-left[
### Reduced Form Diff-in-Diff: directly regulated
- Outcomes:
  - Affiliate-level energy consumption (-\*\*)
  - Revenue (output) (-\*\*)
  - Energy efficiency (~0)

### Reduced Form Diff-in-Diff: related firms regulated
- Outcomes:
  - Affiliate-level energy consumption (+\*\*)
  - Revenue (output) (+\*\*)
  - Energy efficiency (~0)

### Reduced Form Diff-in-Diff: same industry, unregulated
- Outcomes:
  - Revenue (output) (+\*\*)

### $\rightarrow$ Untreated are not unaffected by treatment, a classic SUTVA violation
- Put structure on the spillover(s)

# What does this paper do?

### Disentangling reallocation of production within a conglomerate due to regulation
.pull-left[
![Firm size](STAN2023_insertimage_3.png)
]

.pull-right[
- Size of affiliates must be efficient
  - Conglomerate *can* reallocate capital
- Lets authors infer costs of production at each affiliate
- We don't usually see within-conglomerate, across-affiliate costs of production, but these will determine energy consumption, pollution, profit impacts of reallocation

# What does this paper do?

.pull-left[

.center[![Eq 5](STAN2023_insertimage_5.png)]

- $\delta$ is the decline in production knowledge 
  - "span of control"
- $\alpha$ is the decreasing returns to scale
  - Control the relationship between ranks
  - Taken from literature $\alpha=.9$
- $\phi$ controls the conglomerate ( $j$ ) efficiency
  - If top firm in conglomerate $j$ is in Top 1,000, $\phi_j > \tilde{\phi}$
  - Threshold $\phi_1$ for entry ( $\pi(\phi_1)=0$ )
  - Shadow cost of regulation (cost of within- $i$ reallocation) is decreasing in $\phi$
]

--

.pull-right[

### Shadow cost $\lambda(\phi)$
<br>
- Since number of affiliates in a conglomerate is lumpy, shadow costs $\lambda(\phi)$ are a step function of $n$
- So equilibrium is determined by a single shadow cost for each $n$
- Key to welfare calculations

# What does this paper do?

### Important questions
- Theory of Incomplete Regulation / Leakage
  - Literature has focused on trade (Fowlie (2009), Shapiro and Walker (2018))
  - But what happens within a conglomerate?
  
--

- Related: Theory of Second-Best Regulation
  - Significant contribution in policy analysis section comparing to a energy tax
  - Rules out fuel-switching as large channel, so energy tax is close to Pigouvian under some assumptions

### Why I will assign this paper to my students
- Reduced form estimates + theoretical model are very well linked
  - Model helps decompose the reduced form estimates $\rightarrow$ bias from spillovers
- Assumptions are clear
  - Strong assumptions are well-justified
- Model is only what is necessary

### What I dislike about discussing this paper
- It's already 3rd round R&R at *AER*

### Looking forward: can this be done in the US?

# Discussion

### Framing/positioning in the literature

- Two forms of spillovers: trade (external) and domestic reallocation
  - A unifying framework?
  - Market-level spillovers could be connected to trade "leakage" in a (possibly) straightforward manner
  - Compare magnitudes?
  
  
- Can you get all the way to Pigouvian (second-best)?
  - Difference between "universal energy tax" (in paper) and pigouvian tax:
    - Can switch to cleaner source
    - Spatial variation in pollution

# Discussion


### A few suggestions going forward

- Colmer (2020) finds the opposite results in France. 
  - Typology of market structures?
  - Policy differences (EU-ETS vs. Top 1,000 conservation mandate)
  - Glean from variation across industry in China
  
--

- Alternative explanation: conglomerates "spread" production (and jobs) spatially to gain favor with regional ministers.
  - Larger firms have more to spread around (and are more likely to have a Top 1,000 firm)
  - $\rightarrow$ any change in industry that increases value of political capital will encourage the downward shift of production allocation, appearing equivalent to the Top 1,000 results.
    - Parallel trends should look different (and within-conglomerate DiD results are the opposite, Fig 6A)
  - Are there conglomerates with >1 affiliate in the Top 1,000?
  - What is the sign on a dummy for "2nd in Top 1,000"?

### US Clean Air Act (1970, 1990 am.)
- "Attainment" and "nonattainment" areas
  - "nonattainment" required state plan and regulation to improve criteria pollution levels
  - Chay and Greenstone show large effect of CAA of 1970 on infant mortality (2003) and housing price (2005)
  - But no controls for leakage of the sort measured here
  
  
--

### Holistic measure of effect of CAA
- Decompose effects of CAA on pollution; include reallocation across conglomerates
  - Emissions replace energy consumption
  - Still consider output reallocation
- But CAA "treatment" isn't as direct as in China
  - Nonattainment designation led to varied plans for reducing emissions
  - Most technology-based
  - De facto tradable permits in that new sources could be allowed if offsets were made

# Discussion

### Location, location, location
- Spillovers from CAA move towards unregulated areas
- CAA 1970 **Prevention of Significant Deterioration** (PSD) sought to affect the exact sort of spatial spillover hypothesized here
  - Clean areas could not get significantly worse
  - Affects entry in unregulated ("attainment" areas) and expansions (reallocation of capital)
- All this amgibuity is motivation for decomposing mechanisms

--

### Dose-response
- Non-linear damage function from pollution
  - Carbon probably linear
- So there may be some welfare *increase* in pushing pollution out of nonattainment areas, even if the **total overall pollution levels** were the same
- **Assuming some functional form of "curvature" of a dose-response curve, back out degree of curvature that would rationalize aspects of PSD**
